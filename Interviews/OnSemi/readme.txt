///////////// C++ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

1) Reimplement c++11 lock_guard (NOT use std::lock_guard). Use namespace
      to allow you to call your class impl "lock_guard" and not conflict with
      std::lock_guard

      LockGuard.h          // header file only impl

2) Implement c++11 threading example
      2-3 threads running

3) Use c++11 std::condition_signal in solution from #3 to synchronize threads
      -- Psuedo Code --
      main:
        1) start: thread 1, thread 2, thread 3
        2) all threads block on condition_signal
        3) main signals condition_signal
        4) join all threads to prevent exit main // gimmee

        thread 1:
           break from condition_signal due to step 3
           sleep (random(1,5))
           signal thread 2
           wait on condition_signal

       example output:
         main: starting all threads
         thread1: starting, waiting.
         thread2: starting, waiting.
         thread3: starting, waiting.
         main: starting thread 1.
         thread1: signal received, doing work ....
         thread1: done with work, signal next thread
         thread2: signal received, doing work ....
         thread2: done with work, signal next thread

         on and on and on until you CTRL-C the program

  4) Use your implementation of c++11 lock_guard (NOT std::lock_guard)
     to protect a common resource in your threading example from #3 and #4

  5) Platform Dispatcher
